# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

-   Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information
-   To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad
    -   You can find data visualizations at <https://public.tableau.com/app/discover> or <https://datavizproject.com/>, or anywhere else you like!
-   For each visualization (good and bad):

-   Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
-   How could this data visualization have been improved?

BAD: <https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-02%20at%2010.25.56%20PM.png?width=2250&name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-02%20at%2010.25.56%20PM.png>

The bad chart doesn’t explain what you’re looking at, there’s no clear title, no y-axis label, and no units, so the bars don’t have meaning.
The legend is also unnecessary since there’s only one dataset, and the rainbow of pastel colors adds confusion by implying each month is a different category.
On top of that, the low-contrast styling makes it harder to read quickly, and a bar chart isn’t the best choice for showing a month-to-month trend where the overall shape and direction matter.

The bad chart can be improved by adding a descriptive title and labeling the y-axis with the proper unit so the values are instantly understandable.
Remove the legend, simplify the design, and use one consistent bar color (only highlighting a specific month if there’s a reason).
If the goal is to show changes over time a line chart may show a clearer trend or adding data labels to the bars can reduce visual clutter so the main takeaway stands out immediately.

GOOD: <https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.eneh/viz/PCOSDashboard_17297311153800/pcosdashboard>

This Tableau dashboard works well because it cleanly communicates the topic (“Understanding PCOS”) and then breaks information into small, digestible sections that guide the viewer through what PCOS is, common symptoms, and key impacts.
The layout uses strong visual hierarchy (big headline → short context → charts), and the visuals feel intentional.
It uses simple bar charts for comparisons, clear labels, and a cohesive color palette that supports the topic instead of distracting from it.
Overall, it’s a good example of “data storytelling,” where the design helps people understand a health concept quickly.

Even though it’s strong, it could be improved by increasing readability.
Some text areas look dense, so using bullet points would make scanning easier, and boosting contrast (especially for smaller fonts) would help accessibility.
It would also benefit from adding a visible data/source note (where the numbers come from, year, sample size).

-   Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

-   This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
-   Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
-   Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:

| Component | Scoring | Requirement |
